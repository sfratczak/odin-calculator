# odin-calculator

This calculator has been made as an assignment from The Odin Project curriculum.

As a challenge, I tried to build the whole thing from the grounds up, without copying any code from the internet. Of course, I had to look up syntax for some things, but mostly I wanted to reverse-engineer how macOS's default Calculator app works.
